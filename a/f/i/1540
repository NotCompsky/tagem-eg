    "A much darker take on this lovely old tune: \"King George commands, and we obey, over the hills and far away\".\n\nAs to the political elements, a crusty old cynic might ask: wasn't it ever thus?\n\nArranged and performed here by John Tams, including lyrics, for the TV Series \"Sharpe\" which was set in the Napoleonic Wars - 18031815.\n\nA few people have asked about specific images. Almost all of my YouTube vids comprise my own photography. Not here, however - so all credit due to the original creators of these images (not to mention the principal act here: John Tams' performance and arrangement of this music!).\n\nAt 0:50 the striking image of brave French soldiers in unimaginably harsh conditions is at once frightening, and heartbreaking. Most of us have not even the vaguest grasp of what it means to be fighting in war - except of course for the courageous soldiers of today, many of whom play video-games for fun, relaxation; and yes, relief from the harder truths of military conflict.
