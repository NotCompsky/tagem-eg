    "What might have been...\n\nUnfortunately STD has been a dead duck long before it went into production, and now living on borrowed time with its 4th showrunner.  It shows showing nothing but contempt and ignorance toward the fanbase and the franchise who would have otherwise supported a new Trek show. You can not make Star Trek by employing generic writers and established actors, then giving them full access to the intellectual property, no matter how much of Netflixs money you may wish to spend.\nExamples of failed reboots as a cash grab are becoming more numerous in recent years, I guess doing the same to Star Trek caught me off guard.\n\n\n\n\nI was fortunate enough to have been able to source some excellent quality models and a sound track:\nProduced in Lightwave 3D and Adobe After Effects.\n\nSoundtrack  \"Immortal Star\" - Harry Lightfoot -  Full version here: https://www.positionmusic.com/track/MTE2NjgyNDAtNjQzYTY3/\n\nModified Discovery model - David Metlesits  https://www.deviantart.com/met",
