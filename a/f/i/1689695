    "A video game in the world of hyperbolic space (and spherical space).  Many more details and a whole video series to come, so stay tuned.  I've been working on this project for over a year now and it's so great to finally announce it publicly.\n\nSteam Wishlist: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1256230/Hyperbolica\n\n=== FAQ ===\nQ: Does this use your Non-Euclidean Worlds Engine?\nA: No, I'm using Unity for this and it's a totally different effect (no portals)\n\nQ: What systems will this be released for?\nA: For sure PC/Linux/Mac on Steam, maybe a console if it becomes popular enough.\n\nQ: Will there be a VR version?\nA: Eventually, yes.  But it will likely come as an update.\n\nQ: Is the game free and/or open source?\nA: The game is paid, but the engine will be open source so you can make your own Non-Euclidean games.\n\nMusic by Phil K.\nhttps://willcomposeforfood.com/",
