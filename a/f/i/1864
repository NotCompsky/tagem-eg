    "Alexander the Great. The man who united the west and east. The man who created an empire that covered everything from Greece to India. A true conqueror. A true king.\n\nCarolus Rex. The man who saved his nation from destruction. The man who defeated armies thought to be invincible. The man who nearly crushed three empires at once. A true warrior. A true king.\n\nWith a song about Carolus Rex, and clips showing Alexander the Great, I here pay my respect to two of the greatest strategists, field commanders, warriors and conquerors that the world has ever known. Alexander of Macedonia and Carolus Rex of Sweden. May they both rest in peace.\n\nBand: Sabaton\nSong: \"Carolus Rex\"\nMovies used: \"Alexander\"",
