    "Minecraft Speedrunner VS 3 Hunters FINALE REMATCH. You asked for it. This was insane.\nPatreon (Plugin): https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nFollow my socials:\n Twitter - @dreamwastaken\n Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dreams.is\n\nBadBoyHalo: @BadBoyHalo \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are THREE hunters instead of just one.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do something else.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against",
