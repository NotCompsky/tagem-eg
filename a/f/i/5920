    "Leave a comment on what song you'd like me to do next!\nSUBSCRIBE to see more: https://goo.gl/UgWrFa\n\nThis is a piano cover of the Civ 6 theme Sogno Di Volare by Christopher Tin. I hadn't heard of it before one of you recommended it and I really like the composition and production of the piece, though I'd have probably gone for a little more reverb on the choir at some points. I didn't go for a different style than the original (namely EPIC) because it was just so much fun playing it giving it my all. I hope you like it!\n\nAlso, I finally started recording myself. I will continue to use the visualizations in some videos though. And I will explore different camera angles as time goes by. This is just my phone placed half crooked on the side of the keyboard.\n\nOriginal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQYN2P3E06s\n\nDeja un comentario con cul quieres que sea la siguiente!\nSUSCRIBETE para mantenerte informado: https://goo.gl/Uc599R\n\nEsta es una cover de piano del tema del Civilization 6 Sogno",
