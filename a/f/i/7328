Martin's best-selling novels. In a world where summers span decades and winters can last a lifetime, the crown of Westeros comes with a price. Betrayal, lust, intrigue and supernatural forces shake the four corners of the Kingdom, from the scheming south and the savage eastern lands, to the frozen north and the ancient Wall that protects the realm from the darkness beyond. Kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and noble men vie for power in the bloody struggle for the Iron Throne.\n\nConnect with Game of Thrones Online\nFollow @GameofThrones on Twitter: http://twitter.com/gameofthrones\nFind Game of Thrones on Facebook: http://facebook.com/gameofthrones\nFind Game of Thrones on Instagram: http://instagram.com/gameofthrones\nFind Game of Thrones on Pinterest:\nhttp://pinterest.com/gothbo\nFind ",
