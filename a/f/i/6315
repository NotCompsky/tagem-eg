    "The Green Fields of France\nThe Fureys with Davey Arthur\n\n*Lyrics\n\nWell how do you do, young Willie McBride?\nDo you mind if I sit here down by your graveside,\nAnd rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun?\nI've been walking all day, and I'm nearly done.\nI see by your gravestone you were only nineteen\nWhen you joined the great fall-in in Nineteen-Sixteen.\nI hoped you died well, and I hoped you died clean,\nOr young Willie McBride, was it slow and obscene?\n\nDid they beat the drums slowly,\nDid they play the fife lowly,\nDid they sound the death march as they lowered you down?\nDid the band play the last post and chorus,\nAnd did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?\n\nDid you leave any wife or a sweetheart behind?\nIn some faithful heart, is your memory enshrined?\nAlthough you died back in Nineteen-Sixteen,\nIn that faithful heart are you forever nineteen?\nOr are you a stranger without even a name,\nEnclosed in forever behind the glass frame\nIn an old photograph torn, battered and bent,\nAnd ",
