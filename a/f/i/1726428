    "Hey everyone,\n\nSo, a couple of weeks ago I saw the movie Les Miserables and was pretty blown away. I knew some of the more popular songs from the play, although never really had any clue what the entire story was about.  I thought the movie was so good that I was inspired to learn much more of the music, and am happy to be able to share it with all of you. \n\nI just came off of an 11 day stretch of work including three 26 hour shifts, so I was feeling a little le miserable myself. Hehe. Recording this music has definitely provided some relief from the craziness, and I hope listening to it will as well. \n\nJust fyi, I added in the song \"Suddenly\" from the movie because I thought it plays an integral role in the film, helping to emphasize a critical plot point. The fact that it was written so many years later just for the movie is special enough. \n\nAnyway, I obviously recommend that you see the movie -- and would love it if you would let me know what you think of the music. I hope you enjo",
