    "This is the complete Warthog Run score played during the escape to the Forward Unto Dawn in the late Johnson's warthog. The song on the game itself is dived into sections which are played as you cross different \"zones\" on the map; example: \"70% Charged\" has its own track, and so does 50%, and 10%, they only trigger and play if you cross a \"zone.\" I had to play the level on Easy and \"in-Line\" record (You plug the red and white into the computer and record from a 3rd party app) all of the \"zones\" in theater, while trying to avoid \"Sound triggers\" and other SFX including the warthog sounds becuase Halo3 did not include a \"Sound\" option in thier menu, so I cannot turn off the sound; the ambiance was not avoidable. I got the ending of the track straight from the OST, becuase the voices of Cortana and Master Chief was not avoidable. In the end, it ended up to be at least 7:30 long, but i repeated the \"70%\" again because it is the best part of the run and it was cut from the Official Soundtra",
