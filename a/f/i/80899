    "Huzzah for 10k Subs! Remastered medieval remix of the Halo theme by Marty O'Donnell with real guitars, drums and the awesome Susanna Bailey on flute (https://youtu.be/o2Dlw4usrO8). Tabs/music, requests & more at https://www.patreon.com/LjB0\n\nMassive thanks to OG patrons Leeman Seth Byers, Mint, Schpasm & Thrinmon + new patron James! Your support's probably the key thing that's got me back on the remixing wagon. Cheers pals.\n\n(And yes, got it, Gregorian chants are technically medieval already... I was picturing like 4 musicians/bards playing together in a tavern or something in the original...)\n\nThanks so much for watching & engaging with my videos, means more than you can know. I love making these and would love to keep doing it - have always felt VGM needs a bigger audience. Dream would be to end up scoring a game/film of some kind down the line. You never know.\n\nCheers pals - LjB0\n\n#Halo #MedievalGaming #Bardcore",
