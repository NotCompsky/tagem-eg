    "CORRECTED LYRICS HERE\n\nTaking on water, sailing a restless sea\nFrom a memory, a fantasy\nThe wind carries into white water\nFar from the islands don't you know you're never going to\nGet to France\nMary Queen of chance, will they find you?\nNever going to\nGet to France\nCould a new romance ever bind you?\n\nWalking on foreign ground, like a shadow\nRoaming in far off territory\nOver your shoulder, stories unfold\nYou're searching for sanctuary, you know you're never going to\nGet to France\nMary Queen of chance, will they find you?\nNever going to\nGet to France\nCould a new romance ever bind you?\n\nI see a picture\nBy the lamp's flicker\nIsn't it strange how\nDreams fade and shimmer?\n\nNever going to\nGet to France\nMary Queen of chance, will they find you?\nNever going to\nGet to France\nCould a new romance ever bind you?\nI see a picture\nBy the lamp's flicker\nIsn't it strange how\nDreams fade and shimmer?\nNever going to\nGet to France\nMary Queen of chance, will they find you?\nNever going to\nGet to France\nCould",
