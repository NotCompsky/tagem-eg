    "song: Kill -9\nauthor: Monzy (www.monzy.com)\nLyrics:\n\nyeah!\nyo MC++, you such a fucking hardcore computer scientist... why don't the track numbers of your album start at 0? Bitch!\n\nI guess I'll have to shut you down for good this time,\nAlready tried a SIGQUIT, so now it's KILL DASH 9.\nYou gotta learn when it's time for your thread to yield;\nIt shoulda slept; instead you stepped and now your fate is sealed.\nI'll take your process off the run queue without even asking\n'Cause my flow is like reentrant and preemptive multitasking.\nYour sad rhymes are spinnin' like you're in a deadlock,\nYou're like a synchronous sock that don't know when to block;\nSo I pull out my keyboard and I pull out my glock,\nAnd I dismount your girl and I mount /proc\nAnd I've got your fuckin pid and the bottom line\nIs that you best not front or else it's KILL DASH NINE.\n\nKILL DASH NINE,\nNo more CPU time.\nI run KILL DASH NINE,\nAnd your process is mine.\nI run KILL DASH NINE,\n'Cause it's MY time to shine\nSo don't step out",
