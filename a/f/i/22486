    "Get BrunuhVille's music and follow his Facebook at:\nBandcamp - http://goo.gl/6mhv6\niTunes - http://goo.gl/LnYQ2\nFacebook: https://goo.gl/bFKKfM\nPhysical CD's : http://goo.gl/K0LFrk\nSubscribe : http://goo.gl/uTwZH\n\nSong: Spirit of the Wild\nAlbum: Age of Wonders\nYear: 2015\nCopyright  BrunuhVille\n\nHere's a little song I started while composing \"The Voice of the Forest\".\nI usually get tired of listening the same song for hours during days and weeks. It's one of the weird things about making music is that no matter how much you like the song you're creating you will end up \"hating\" it by the time you're done because you're just tired of listening to it over and over. When this happens I tend to start something new to release some stress and clear my head. This song was born in one of those moments. It's a really simple song with a Celtic touch to it but I hope you guys enjoy it anyway! :)\n\nBig thanks to Sharm for singing the little line of \"Ah's\" by the end of the song\nhttps://www.yo",
